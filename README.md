## Overview
- This project will be recreating the game Mini Metro in Processing. The game will involve spawning train stations of a certain shape (circle, triangle, or square) in a certain interval of time. At each station, passengers will spawn wanting to go to another station which will be indicated by the shape of the passenger. The goal of the player is to connect train routes through the train stations to avoid overcrowding at any station. If overcrowding occurs too frequently, then it is game over and the score is the number of passengers served.

## Instructions
- Press Play or Tutorial to enter the game or read a tutorial, respectively.
- Joining Stations: Click on one station and then another to connect them to the selected train route. A station cannot be added to a route if it is already in the middle of that route. Stations can be a part of two or more different routes at the same time.
- Removing Stations: Double click on a station to remove it from a train line. Removing a station from a type of route color requires you to have that route color to be selected.
- Switching Routes: Press spacebar to cycle through which train route you are editing (RED, BLUE, YELLOW).
- Passengers: Keep an eye on what passengers (circle, triangle, square) passengers are at stations since they only want to land on that type of station. If a passenger remains at a station for too long, they add to your crowding counter. If a station is at max capacity, you also risk adding to your crowding counter. A passenger successfully being dropped off at another station tallies one point to your total score.
- Ending game: You lose if your crowd counter exceeds 50, you win if your total score rises above 500.
- Pause: Press the pause button on the top of the game screen to freeze the game. You may use this to take a break and/or to edit your train network without the game running and causing passenger crowding.
- If you want to play again after winning/losing, you must run the program again.
